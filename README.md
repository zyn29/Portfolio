# My First Portfolio Website - A Windows 95 Throwback

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, designed with a nostalgic nod to the classic Windows 95 operating system! This site showcases who I am, what I do, and my skills, all wrapped in a familiar and fun retro interface. Built using fundamental web technologies – HTML5 for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for (potential) interactive elements reminiscent of the era – this project represents my first step into web development with a distinctly vintage twist.

## Overview

This website aims to recreate the look and feel of Windows 95, featuring elements such as:

* **Homepage "Desktop":** An initial screen with icons and potentially a "Start" button.
* **"Windows":** Sections like "About Me," "Portfolio/Projects," and "Gallery" are presented as separate, draggable windows.
* **Classic UI Elements:** Using fonts, colors, and visual cues reminiscent of the Windows 95 aesthetic (e.g., chunky borders, system colors).

The site includes the following key sections, presented as "windows":

* **About Me:** A detailed window providing insights into my skills, experiences, and interests.
* **Portfolio/Projects:** A window showcasing my projects, demonstrating my abilities and accomplishments. (Initially, this might feature placeholders or descriptions of future projects.)
* **Contact:** A window containing information on how to get in touch with me.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Provides the semantic structure and content of the website, forming the base of the "windows" and other UI elements.
* **CSS:** Styles the website to mimic the visual appearance of Windows 95, including colors, fonts (like MS Sans Serif), borders, and window styling.
* **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity, such as draggable windows, "Start" menu functionality (if implemented), and potentially other UI interactions reminiscent of the operating system.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

If you're a developer interested in exploring the retro codebase:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if this project is hosted on a platform like GitHub):
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [project directory name]
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser** to experience the Windows 95-inspired portfolio.

## Features (Current and Future)

**Currently Implemented:**

* ✅A basic "desktop" layout with visual elements inspired by Windows 95.
* ✅Key sections ("About Me," "Portfolio") styled to resemble classic Windows.
* ✅Potentially basic JavaScript for draggable "windows" or "Start" menu functionality.

**Future Enhancements (Planned):**

*⚙️ More refined visual elements to more closely match the Windows 95 aesthetic.
*⚙️ Enhanced JavaScript for smoother window dragging and other interactive elements.
*⚙️ A functional "Start" menu with links to different sections.
*⚙️ Icons and other visual assets reminiscent of the operating system.
* ⚙️Responsive design considerations, while maintaining the retro look on different screen sizes (a fun challenge!).

## Learnings and Reflections

Building this Windows 95-inspired portfolio has been a unique and engaging learning experience. I've gained practical experience in:

* Structuring web content to mimic a desktop environment.
* Using CSS to achieve a specific and nostalgic visual style.
* Potentially leveraging JavaScript to add UI interactivity reminiscent of an operating system.
* Thinking creatively about how to present information in an unconventional and memorable way.

This project demonstrates my willingness to think outside the box and apply my web development skills in a fun and distinctive manner. It's a testament to the idea that learning can be both educational and entertaining!
